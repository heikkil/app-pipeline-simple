Pipeline::Simple version 0.4

This module is a simple pipeline manager that can execute a (brancing)
series of commands the are interdependent. It implements an equivalent
of a unix pipeline where all intermediate steps are stored in files.

A pipeline reads its instructions from a structured configuration
file, builds internal representation of the execution graph, and
starts the execution. The user interaction is done using a command
line program that can give starting parameters to the pipeline. The
execution can be stopped any time, a local copy of the instructions can
be modified and the execution can resume at any point.
